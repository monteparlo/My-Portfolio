            <h2>I am..</h2>
            <h3>A Graphic Designer, A Web Developer, A Coder, Singer, Songwriter, Dancer, and SO much more.</h3>
            <p>I have been a freelancer for over 20 years. I started at a very long age creating digital art on Microsoft Paint. Knitting and Crocheting followed shortly after. Before I knew it, I was desiging and creating murals, business cards, t-shirt designs, and flyers.</p>
            <p>My background is Haitian-American, but my 23 & Me states I'm mixed with just about a little bit of everything!</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I now live in Hollywood, Florida.</p>
            <p>My dream is to become the greatest web developer and graphic designer. Every day I am always learning something new in order to make sure it happens.</p>
            <p>I also hope to be able to teach others as well. I just know I have a lot to learn in the meantime before I get good enough to do so.</p>
            <p>One day I hope to raise enough money to own a lounge where I can put on events and workshops that allows students to have opportunities to express their creativity.</p>
